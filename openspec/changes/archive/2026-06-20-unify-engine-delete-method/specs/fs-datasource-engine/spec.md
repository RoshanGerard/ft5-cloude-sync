## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Directory delete and unsupported `getQuota` throw `Unsupported`

`delete(target: Target, entryKind: EntryKind)` SHALL throw `DatasourceError` with `tag === "unsupported"` when `entryKind === "directory"`, for every provider in this change regardless of the target. `getQuota()` SHALL throw the same when called on a client whose `providerDescriptor.capabilities.quota === false`. The thrown error's `raw` field MAY carry a human-readable reason (e.g., `"disabled-for-product-stability"` vs `"not-supported-by-provider"`) but the `tag` SHALL be identical in both cases.

#### Scenario: delete with entryKind "directory" throws Unsupported

- **WHEN** any concrete client's `delete({ kind: "path", path: "/anything" }, "directory")` is invoked
- **THEN** the method throws a `DatasourceError` with `tag === "unsupported"` (the engine emits no event)

#### Scenario: getQuota throws Unsupported on S3

- **WHEN** `client.getQuota()` is invoked on an `S3Client`
- **THEN** the method throws a `DatasourceError` with `tag === "unsupported"` (the engine emits no event)

#### Scenario: getQuota succeeds on providers with quota

- **WHEN** `client.getQuota()` is invoked on a `GoogleDriveClient` with valid credentials
- **THEN** the method resolves with a `Quota` object carrying `used: number` and `quota: number`, both non-negative integers

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Public contract is the generic `DatasourceClient<T>` Strategy interface

The engine SHALL export a public interface `DatasourceClient<T extends DatasourceType>` with the methods `status`, `testConnection`, `authenticate`, `listDirectory`, `search`, `getMetadata`, `uploadFile`, `delete`, `getQuota`, `rename`, and `downloadFile`. The delete surface is the single method `delete(target: Target, entryKind: EntryKind): Promise<void>`; the methods `createFile`, `cancelUpload`, `deleteFile`, and `deleteDirectory` are NOT present (`createFile`/`cancelUpload` deleted by prior changes; `deleteFile`/`deleteDirectory` collapsed into the unified `delete`). The type parameter `T` SHALL flow into every generic return payload (`FileEntry<T>`, `FileMetadata<T>`). Concrete implementations (`S3Client`, `OneDriveClient`, `GoogleDriveClient`) SHALL conform to this interface and SHALL be constructible only via the engine's factory — not via `new` directly by consumers.

#### Scenario: Every concrete client conforms to the shared interface

- **WHEN** a contract test in `packages/fs-datasource-engine/src/__tests__/strategy-contract.ts` enumerates every exported client class
- **THEN** each class is `assignable` to `DatasourceClient<its provider type>`, every method on the interface is present with the correct signature (no `createFile`, no `cancelUpload`, no `deleteFile`/`deleteDirectory` — replaced by `delete`), and a shared suite of scenarios (list, search, upload via signal-driven cancel, delete, error, rename, download with rangeStart, AbortSignal-driven download cancel) passes against each

#### Scenario: Consumers program to the interface, not the concrete class

- **WHEN** a Vitest test scans `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/` and `services/fs-sync/src/commands/` for type annotations
- **THEN** handler call sites annotate the engine value as `DatasourceClient<DatasourceType>` (or a narrower union), not as `S3Client` / `OneDriveClient` / `GoogleDriveClient` directly

### Requirement: Hybrid `Target` type supports both path and handle addressing

The engine SHALL define `type Target = { kind: "path"; path: string } | { kind: "handle"; handle: string }` in `packages/ipc-contracts`. Every method that addresses a filesystem location (`listDirectory`, `getMetadata`, `uploadFile`, `delete`, `search` scope) SHALL accept `Target` as its location parameter. `FileEntry<T>` SHALL always carry both `path: string` and `handle: string` so any entry returned by a list call can be re-addressed by either mechanism. Internally, each concrete strategy SHALL maintain an LRU path↔handle cache. Cache invalidation SHALL be **internal to each mutating op** — the strategy evicts inline within the operation's success branch, before returning; invalidation is purely inline (the engine has no event bus):

- On successful `uploadFile`: `doUploadFileImpl` populates the LRU directly inside its success branch.
- On successful `delete` of a file (`entryKind === "file"`): `doDeleteFileImpl` evicts the deleted entry's path (path-form target) or handle (handle-form target) from the LRU inside its success branch.
- On successful `rename`: `doRenameImpl` evicts the old path from the LRU inside its success branch; for a directory rename it ALSO evicts every cached descendant under the old-path prefix. When an `overwrite` rename internally deletes a colliding sibling at the destination, that sibling's cached path is evicted too. Eviction is evict-only — the new path resolves fresh on next access.
- The `createFile` invalidation path is not relevant: `createFile` does not exist on the engine surface.

A strategy with no path cache (e.g., S3, whose keys are paths) satisfies this requirement vacuously: it has nothing to evict and a re-address always reaches the provider. Cache invalidation is performed inline by the mutating op; the engine has no event bus and no operation emits an event.

#### Scenario: listDirectory accepts a path target

- **WHEN** a caller invokes `client.listDirectory({ kind: "path", path: "/photos/2024" })` against a client whose datasource has that folder
- **THEN** the method resolves with a non-empty `FileEntry<T>[]` whose entries each carry both a `path` field starting with `/photos/2024/` and a non-empty `handle` string

#### Scenario: listDirectory accepts a handle target

- **WHEN** a caller obtains a `FileEntry<T>` from a prior `listDirectory` call, then invokes `client.listDirectory({ kind: "handle", handle: entry.handle })` where `entry.kind === "folder"`
- **THEN** the method resolves with the children of that folder, and no path-resolution round-trip is issued to the provider (observable in a spy-wrapped strategy test)

#### Scenario: Handle cache is populated by upload success internally

- **WHEN** a strategy's `doUploadFileImpl` resolves successfully with an entry whose `path` was not previously in the LRU
- **THEN** the LRU contains `entry.path → entry.handle` after the call resolves; no event is emitted (the engine has no event bus)

#### Scenario: Handle cache is invalidated by deletion

- **WHEN** a strategy successfully deletes an entry at a known cached path, then another operation addresses the same path
- **THEN** the strategy does NOT return the cached handle; the second operation re-resolves the path (observable by a spy on the provider's name-resolution API)

#### Scenario: Handle cache is invalidated by rename

- **WHEN** a strategy successfully renames a file from a known cached path `/old` to `/new`, then another operation addresses `/old`
- **THEN** the strategy does NOT return the stale cached handle for `/old` — the operation re-resolves (the provider reports `/old` no longer exists) — and addressing `/new` resolves to the renamed entry

#### Scenario: Directory rename invalidates cached descendants

- **WHEN** a strategy successfully renames a directory from `/foo` to `/bar` while descendants such as `/foo/a.txt` were cached in the LRU
- **THEN** subsequent addresses of `/foo` and of any cached `/foo/...` descendant do NOT return cached handles; each re-resolves against the provider

#### Scenario: Overwrite rename evicts the displaced sibling's cached path

- **WHEN** a strategy performs a `rename` with `conflictPolicy: "overwrite"` that internally deletes a colliding sibling at the destination path, and that sibling's path was cached
- **THEN** the displaced sibling's cached path entry is evicted; a subsequent address of that path re-resolves (eviction is inline; the engine has no event bus)

#### Scenario: Path-cache eviction is internal to the mutating op

- **WHEN** a strategy that maintains a path↔handle cache is constructed
- **THEN** it does NOT register any subscription to invalidate that cache (the engine has no event bus); eviction occurs only inline within the strategy's own successful mutating op

#### Scenario: Every cached strategy honors the invalidation invariant (shared contract)

- **WHEN** the shared strategy-contract suite runs against a concrete strategy whose fixture declares `hasPathHandleCache: true`
- **THEN** after a successful `delete` of a cached file path the cache no longer holds that path, and after a successful `rename` the old path is evicted — so every present and future cached strategy is held to the invariant (a strategy whose fixture declares `hasPathHandleCache: false` satisfies it vacuously)

#### Scenario: Path ambiguity surfaces via providerMetadata

- **WHEN** a provider permits duplicate sibling names (e.g., Google Drive) and a `{kind: "path"}` `Target` resolves to more than one provider-side item under the same (parent, name) filter
- **THEN** the strategy selects the oldest hit (e.g., Drive orders by `createdTime asc`), populates the returned `FileEntry<T>.providerMetadata` with `ambiguous: true` and an `ambiguousSiblings` list containing the other items' handles, and the ambiguity is carried only on the returned entry's `providerMetadata` — the engine emits no event

### Requirement: Strategy LRU path-handle invalidation on upload completion is internal

Drive and OneDrive strategies maintain a path-handle LRU cache. After this migration, LRU population on successful upload SHALL be performed internally inside `doUploadFileImpl` (calling `this.pathHandleCache.set(entry.path, entry.handle)` directly before returning), NOT via any event bus. Strategy constructors register NO bus subscriptions (the engine has no event bus); deletion/rename eviction is performed inline within `doDeleteFileImpl` / `doRenameImpl` (see Requirement: Hybrid `Target` type supports both path and handle addressing).

#### Scenario: Drive LRU is populated by uploadFile success

- **WHEN** an upload to Google Drive resolves successfully and returns an entry whose `path` was not previously in the strategy's LRU
- **THEN** the LRU contains `entry.path → entry.handle` after the call resolves; no event is emitted (the engine has no event bus)

#### Scenario: OneDrive LRU is populated by uploadFile success

- **WHEN** an upload to OneDrive resolves successfully and returns an entry whose `path` was not previously in the strategy's LRU
- **THEN** the LRU contains `entry.path → entry.handle` after the call resolves; no event is emitted (the engine has no event bus)

#### Scenario: Drive LRU is invalidated inline by delete of a file

- **WHEN** `delete` of a file (`entryKind === "file"`) succeeds for a path present in the strategy's LRU
- **THEN** the strategy evicts that path's LRU entry inline within `doDeleteFileImpl` (there is no bus subscription; the engine has no event bus)

### Requirement: Google Drive status / testConnection fail-fast on insufficient scope

When `status()` or `testConnection()` is invoked on a `GoogleDriveClient`, the strategy SHALL — before issuing the existing `about.get` probe — assert that the credential's stored scope grants the engine's mutating operations. The check is satisfied if and only if the space-separated `meta.scope` string contains the literal token `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (string equality on a space-tokenized split, NOT a prefix match). Other Drive scopes (`drive.file`, `drive.readonly`, `drive.metadata.readonly`, `drive.appdata`) SHALL be considered insufficient on their own, even if combined with each other, because the engine performs `uploadFile` and `delete` operations.

#### Scenario: Sufficient scope passes the check

- **GIVEN** a `GoogleDriveClient` whose `meta.scope === "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"`
- **WHEN** `status()` is called
- **THEN** no `tokeninfo` request is made, the existing `about.get` probe is issued, and the method resolves with `"connected"`

### Requirement: Rename conflict surfaces `DatasourceError { tag: "conflict" }` when policy is "fail"

The `DatasourceErrorTag` taxonomy SHALL include a new member `Conflict = "conflict"`. When `rename` is called with `conflictPolicy: "fail"` and the target name collides with an existing remote sibling at the same parent path, the call SHALL reject with `DatasourceError { tag: "conflict", retryable: false, raw: { existingPath: string } }`.

When `conflictPolicy: "overwrite"`, the engine SHALL delete the colliding sibling (via a direct provider delete) before performing the rename; the operation SHALL resolve with the new entry; the internal delete of the colliding sibling is not surfaced separately (the engine emits no event).

#### Scenario: Rename with policy "overwrite" replaces the colliding sibling

- **WHEN** the user renames `foo.pdf` to `bar.pdf`, `bar.pdf` exists, and `conflictPolicy: "overwrite"`
- **THEN** the engine deletes the existing `bar.pdf` first, then performs the rename; the call resolves with the new entry; the internal delete of the colliding sibling is not separately surfaced (the engine emits no event)

### Requirement: Template base class wraps every operation with refresh coordination and error normalization

The engine SHALL provide `abstract class BaseDatasourceClient<T extends DatasourceType>` that concrete strategies extend. The base SHALL wrap delete, rename, downloadFile, uploadFile, status, testConnection, and the read operations so that it (a) calls `normalizeError(e)` to convert any raw exception to a typed `DatasourceError<T>` before throwing, and (b) returns the typed result on success. The base SHALL NOT emit any event and SHALL NOT define, hold, or inject an event bus. The base SHALL NOT auto-refresh credentials on `auth-expired`; a normalized `auth-expired` error surfaces to the caller unchanged. Token refresh is exposed as the public single-flight `refreshCredentials()` primitive (see Requirement: Token refresh is single-flight per datasource), invoked explicitly by callers (typically via the exported `withAuthRefresh` helper). Concrete strategies SHALL implement only the `protected abstract doX(...)` methods plus `refreshTokenImpl()` and `normalizeError(raw)`. Strategies SHALL NOT emit events and SHALL NOT reference an event bus.

#### Scenario: Base reports operation outcome via return value or thrown error

- **WHEN** a strategy's `doDeleteFileImpl` or `doRenameImpl` resolves or throws
- **THEN** the base returns the typed result (the deleted target, or the new `DatasourceFileEntry<T>`) on success, or throws the normalized `DatasourceError<T>` on failure — and no event is emitted (the engine has no event bus)

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: `deleteDirectory` and unsupported `getQuota` throw `Unsupported`

**Reason**: The dedicated `deleteDirectory` method is removed; its global directory-delete `Unsupported` refusal is preserved and relocated into the unified `delete(target, entryKind)` method (see the ADDED requirement "Directory delete and unsupported `getQuota` throw `Unsupported`", which carries the identical behavior plus the unchanged `getQuota` scenarios).

**Migration**: Callers that invoked `deleteDirectory(target)` now call `delete(target, "directory")` and catch the same `DatasourceError { tag: "unsupported" }`. No wire-level or error-tag change.
